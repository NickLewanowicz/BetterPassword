# BetterPassword Solution

This is an attempt from a few friends and I to create a new password solution that is easy to remember, computationally expensive to crack, and randomly generated. To accomplish this we leverage several cognitive processes like semantic encoding, visual queue recall, and option filtering. The app is available [here](https://nicklewanowicz.github.io/BetterPassword-HCI/) to try out yourself, results will be collected ongoing and parsed to find out if this is a successful password solution. You can read the full disclosure on the website but no personal information will be stored.
